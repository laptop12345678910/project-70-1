    Welcome to my school</h1>.<h3>Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school. School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what my school has taught me.

    We have all been to school and we have loved each and every moment we have spent over there as those were the building blocks of our lives. A school is a place where students are taught the fundamentals of life, as well as how to grow and survive in life. It instils in us values and principles that serve as the foundation for a child’s development.
    
    My school is my second home where I spend most of my time. Above all, it gives me a platform to do better in life and also builds my personality. I feel blessed to study in one of the most prestigious and esteemed schools in the city. In addition, my school has a lot of assets which makes me feel fortunate to be a part of it. Let us look at the essay on my school written below.

    The types of books we can have access to in school libraries are
     fiction books, non-fiction books, reference books, literature books,
      biographies, General Knowledge books, Fables and folktales, cookbooks
       and craft books, poetry books,
     books in a series, and wordless books.Importance of School Library
     It provides us with quality fiction and nonfiction books that encourage us to read more for pleasure and enrich our intellectual, artistic, cultural, social and emotional growth. The ambiance of the school library is perfect for learning without getting disturbed.
     
     This makes it easy for us to learn and grasp faster. It provides teachers the access to professional development, relevant information and reference material to plan and implement effective learning programs.
     
     Thus. School library is helpful to every member of the school community whether its students, teachers or any other staff member. It helps gain skills and knowledge for personal development.
     
     School library has a positive impact on the academic performance of the students. It helps us develop the overall skills necessary to succeed in the modern-day digital and social environment. It is important to develop the habit of visiting the library regularly.
     
     Role of a School Librarian
     Librarian has an important role to play in the effective functioning of the school library. Librarian has the essential skills to guide and support the library users learning, and help them develop into independent readers and learners. School librarian mainly performs the role of a teacher, information specialist, instructional partner, and program administrator.
     
     Librarians are not merely the caretakers of books anymore they are the consultants, information providers, instructional readers, curriculum designers, and teachers. They can help students in achieving their goals.
     
     The setup of the libraries has also changed into more like classroom setup. The role of the school librarian is to empower others with resources, information, skills, and knowledge and establish flexible learning and teaching environment.
     
     School librarian is like teaching staff and has a vital role to play in supporting literacy and impact students’ learning in a positive way. School librarian supports the learning of the students and helps them develop into efficient independent learners and readers.

     Education and library are interrelated and fundamentally co-exist with each other. Education is the process of gaining knowledge, values, skills, habits, and beliefs. It is the social process in which children are subjected to the influence of the school environment to attain social competence personnel development.
     
     Education is the outcome of the knowledge and experience acquired. Library, on the other hand, is the source and storehouse of knowledge, information, and resources vital for the leap in the advancement of knowledge. Libraries enhance the cause of education and research.
     
     A library plays an important role in meeting the growing needs of people in literacy. The library is essential for self-education, a means of information and knowledge. Education is the complex social process of gaining knowledge and experience formally. In involves a system used for the development of the students.

    <p>The Power of Speech & Debate Education
      Debate is a valuable activity for students of all skill levels.
        Debate teaches useful skills for other academic pursuits and life more generally.
           Most obviously, debaters build confidence speaking in public and expressing
            their ideas eloquently.  That comfort speaking in front of others is useful in so many
             areas of life, from interviews to school presentations to discussions in college seminars.
      But the benefits of debating are not limited to the skills built while students are speaking—the
       preparation for competition teaches critical thinking and research skills, as well.  As F.
        Scott Fitzgerald once said, “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold
         two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.” 
          Debate tests and builds that ability by forcing students to see both sides of issues.  Debaters 
          flex their analytical muscles, learning to find the weak points in opponent’s arguments.  They
           learn to explain their own ideas and assess different viewpoints, whether in a debate round, a political
            discussion, a classroom, or a written essay.  And debate requires students to research their ideas and 
            support them with evidence, teaching them to conduct
             research and assess sources.  According to Arne Duncan, then-Secretary of 
             Education,
              debate is “uniquely suited” to build skills required of a modern citizen, including critical thinking,
               communication, collaboration, and creativity. Those skills help students express their thoughts 
               better in their academic work and their college applications
                (not to mention around your dinner table!).   The College Board recently
                 revamped the SAT test to focus more on exactly the sorts of skills debate 
                 teaches.  As the New York Times explained, students taking the new version of the test
                  must write “a critical response to a specific 
                  argument” based on analysis rather than personal experience. 
                   Debaters are used to responding to unfamiliar arguments in time-sensitive
                    situations; thinking critically about a written passage on the SAT is
                     not so different from responding to an opponent’s argument in a 
                     debate round.  Debaters likewise outscore non-debaters on every 
                     section of the ACT.  Studies across the country have found that
                     high school debate improves reading ability, grades, school attendance, 
                     self-esteem, and interest in school.  Duffin, Frank, Latitudes
                      in Learning, “Debate Across the Curriculum Results” (2005).  Many
                       universities even offer scholarships specifically for college debaters.
For those who commit to speech and debate, it offers a lifetime of benefits.  Forbes published an 
article titled “How to Find the Millennials Who Will Lead Your Company,” suggesting that the
 leaders of the future are ex-debaters.  As that article notes, debate teaches “how to persuade,
  how to present clearly, and how to connect with an audience,” exactly the skills businesses
   look for in their young employees.  You’ll find ex-debaters in every area of public life, 
   from Bruce Springsteen to Oprah Winfrey to Nelson Mandela.  60% of Congressional representatives
    participated in debate, as well as at least a third of the Supreme Court.  There are ex-debaters
     excelling in business, law, politics, academia, and many other fields.Perhaps most important of all
     , debate is fun!  You may have to cajole your son or daughter to go to their test prep class or 
     do their homework, but debate makes learning a game; students build their critical thinking and speaking
     skills without it ever feeling like work.   Debate gives students a rare opportunity to take 
     ownership over their own intellectual development.  And throughout the years of practice
      and competition, debate builds lifelong friendships and community, teaching teamwork
       as well. </p>
